Water is a human right.,Agree,"Water is essential to life. Unless you believe in murder, surely you agree that everyone should be allowed access to the things necessary to live.","That's correct! Water is a human right, because it's necessary to live.","Unfortunately, access to drinkable water is far from guaranteed, both in America and in the world. Nestl√© has bought rights to water in America and abroad, resulting in drought that puts indigenous peoples, other residents, and ecosystems at risk. A billionare couple California, called the Resnicks, bought and own a large water bank which was built using public taxpayer money. They sell the water at a profit in the form of bottled water, and also use for water-intensive crops in this drought-prone state. Overuse of water by corporations and billianaires is one factor that liely led to the fast-spreading wildfires of early 2025.",https://indigenouspeoples-sdg.org/index.php/english/ttt/896-while-nestle-extracts-millions-of-litres-from-their-land-residents-have-no-drinking-water,https://usaherald.com/billionaire-power-couples-control-of-californias-water-amid-wildfire-crisis/,
Food is a human right.,Agree,Everyone has to eat. People are not gods; we should not get to pick and choose who deserves to live and have a full stomach. Everyone does.,"Of course it is! We all need food. Beyond simply allowing us to live, food brigns people together as families and communities and allows us to celebrate our cultures and traditions.","Sadly, corporations and the Trump administration are working together to take away this fundamental human right from many Americans. Most SNAP/Food Stamp recipients work full-time, but still need Food Stamps to get by because they aren't being paid enough. Food Stamps is a relatively inexpensive portion of the federal budget, at least when compared to military spending, but the Trump administration plans to cut it. This will leave 700,000 potentially hungry. Without a federal program to rely on, community-driven mutual aid efforts, food banks, and charity, will become even more essential. If you have the time and the means, it is worth volunteering.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/walmart-and-mcdonalds-among-top-employers-of-medicaid-and-food-stamp-beneficiaries.html,https://time.com/5744647/trump-food-stamps-rule/,
